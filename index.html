      <p>Hi my name is Karl, I'm 27 years old, and I love playing video games. I got into playing video games after watching my Dad play mega man x on super nintendo, and I have been playing them ever since.
        I also spend lots of my time with my lovey wife Stephanie, we explore new places and have all kinds of fun. When not doing that I'm playing with my friends exploring new worlds though video games,
        or by playing DnD with them on Saturdays. 
    </p>
     
    <p>I'm a hard worker, and love to constantly solve problems, especially ones that are tricky. Being on a computer is more home to me then anything else.I was born and raised in Berwyn, Illinois
        where I lived a good majority of my life before moving to Oregon. My other hobbies include interests include dragons, dinosaurs and mock battles. I'm a very simple guy and do my best to work with others.
